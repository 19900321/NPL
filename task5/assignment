Assignment
• 1. Summarize the reasons of overfitting and underfitting. Put them in github repository.

Overfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm captures the noise of the data.
overfitting occurs when the model or the algorithm fits the data too well.  
overfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low bias but high variance.
Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data. 
underfitting occurs when the model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough. 
underfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low variance but high bias. 
Underfitting is often a result of an excessively simple model.
